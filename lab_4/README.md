- **Data Structure**: Each feedback object contains:
  ```javascript
  {
    id: timestamp,
    fullName: string,
    email: string,
    department: string,
    rating: number (1-5),
    comments: string,
    timestamp: string
  }
  ```

### Form Validation
- **Email Validation**: Regex pattern for email format validation
- **Required Fields**: All mandatory fields are validated before submission
- **Real-time Feedback**: Character count and visual indicators

### Event Handling
- **Form Submission**: Prevents default, validates data, stores in localStorage
- **Character Counting**: Updates count and color based on text length
